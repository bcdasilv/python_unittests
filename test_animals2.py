# A house may have any number of pets living in it. The two possible
# types of pets that can live in a house are dogs and cats. Each dog or cat
# has a name. An animalâ€™s house is its one and only home. You can tell an
# animal to make noise and it will do it in its own way.

# Req clarification (better scoping): Animals can be created with any name except empty strings.

# New req: Animals gain weight every time they eat. Dogs gain 5 units while cats gain 2. 
# Animals start with a default of weight of 1 unit
