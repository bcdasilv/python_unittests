# A house may have any number of pets living in it. The two possible
# types of pets that can live in a house are dogs and cats. Each dog or cat
# has a name. An animalâ€™s house is its one and only home. You can tell an
# animal to make noise and it will do it in its own way.

# New req: Animals gain weight everytime they eat. Dogs gain 5 units while cats gain 2.

# New req: Animals make their own noise only if their weight is above their initial weight.
